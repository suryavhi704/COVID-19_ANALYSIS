### 🔍 **Key Highlights:**

* ⚡ **Prophet Forecasting Power:**
  Utilized **Facebook’s Prophet 📈** to model and forecast daily COVID-19 cases, capturing **seasonal patterns, changepoints**, and **holiday effects** with high precision. It helped in predicting future case trends country-wise.

* 🌐 **3D Global Visualization:**
  Created **stunning 3D visualizations 🗺️** on a **world map**, making it easy to observe the geographical spread and intensity of the virus. This added a **dynamic, visual storytelling layer** to the analysis.

* 🧹 **Robust Data Preprocessing:**

  * Cleaned and transformed large-scale global COVID-19 datasets 📊
  * Managed missing values and standardized time formats 🕒
  * Grouped data by country and region for comparative analysis 🧩

* 🔮 **Forecasting & Analysis:**

  * Predicted future trends in infections, recoveries, and fatalities 🚦
  * Analyzed impacts of global interventions (lockdowns, travel bans) 🧳🚫
  * Evaluated model performance using metrics like **RMSE & MAPE** 🎯
